# RemoteEDU

In the time of COVID-19, remote education is becoming the new norm. To help improve our education from home, this app allows students and instructors to connect, schedule class meetings, and creating courses. 

## Future Goals

We would like to add a feature that allows instructors to create and deploy assignments (i.e. homework, tests, projects, etc.). Students will be able to complete assignment within the app, and submit them, and recieve feedback from their instructors. We would also like to provide a way for student to embed their class meetings on a page and take notes while in the app (additionally, adding a code editor for CS classes.)
